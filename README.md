##  Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd text_summarizer
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download NLTK resources (automatic on first run):**
   The application automatically downloads required NLTK resources (`punkt`, `stopwords`) on first run.

##  Usage

1. **Start the application:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser and navigate to:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

3. **Using the summarizer:**
   - Paste your Tamil text in the input box
   - Select the number of sentences for the summary
   - Choose your preferred summarization method
   - Click "சுருக்கவும்" (Summarize) to generate the summary

##  Summarization Methods Explained

### 1. TextRank
Uses a graph-based ranking algorithm similar to Google's PageRank. Sentences are ranked based on their similarity to other sentences in the text. The algorithm combines:
- PageRank scores (70% weight)
- Sentence frequency scores (30% weight)

### 2. Frequency-Based
Calculates word frequencies across the document and scores sentences based on the cumulative frequency of their words. Sentences with higher scores are selected for the summary.

### 3. Abstractive (mT5)
Uses the `csebuetnlp/mT5_multilingual_XLSum` pre-trained model from Hugging Face. This method generates new sentences that capture the meaning of the original text, rather than extracting existing sentences.

##  Configuration

You can modify the following parameters in `summarizer.py`:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `num_sentences` | 3 | Number of sentences in extractive summary |
| `max_length` | 100 | Maximum length for abstractive summary |
| `min_length` | 30 | Minimum length for abstractive summary |
| `num_beams` | 4 | Beam search width for mT5 |

##  API Reference

### Summarization Functions

```python
# TextRank summarization
textrank_summary(text, num_sentences=3)

# Frequency-based summarization
frequency_summary(text, num_sentences=3)

# Abstractive summarization
abstractive_summary(text, max_length=100)
```
